# Repository for python_training

Questions to trainer:
1. If I understand the differences between the code generated from Katalon recorder and my code after fixes (I mean the difference caused by BY library in my project) are typical for this course, and other students had the same issue?
2. Is there any chance to improve katalon recorder to avoid such differences as described above? If yes it might be helpful to put additional comment the point about making the first test?
